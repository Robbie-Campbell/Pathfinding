## :sparkles: a 2d pathfinding project :sparkles:
 
#### This is more of a place where i can dump any 2d sidescroller code that i create, i am using assets from the unity store as a placeholder. There are some cool concepts! such as: 
> dialog 

> animation

> pathfinding (obviously)

#### And much more! So please as always:
# :shipit: ENJOY! :shipit:
